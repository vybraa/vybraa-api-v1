# Flutterwave Webhook API - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

A complete Flutterwave webhook API that handles payment events, manages transactions, and updates request statuses following the same pattern as Paystack webhooks.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`src/payment/dtos/flutterwave-webhook.dto.ts`** - Webhook DTOs

   - FlutterwaveWebhookDto
   - FlutterwaveWebhookData
   - FlutterwaveCustomer
   - FlutterwaveCard

2. **`FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK.md`** - Complete webhook documentation
3. **`src/payment/FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_TESTING.md`** - Testing guide with payloads

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/payment/payment.service.ts`**

   - Added `handleFlutterwaveWebhook()` - Main webhook processor
   - Added `processFlutterwavePaymentSuccess()` - Handle successful payments
   - Added `processFlutterwavePaymentFailed()` - Handle failed payments
   - Added `processFlutterwaveTransferCompleted()` - Handle transfers
   - Added `processFlutterwaveRefundCompleted()` - Handle refunds

2. **`src/payment/payment.controller.ts`**
   - Added `POST /payment/flutterwave/webhook` endpoint
   - Imported FlutterwaveWebhookDto

## 🎯 Supported Events

| Event                  | Description        | Action                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **charge.completed**   | Payment successful | Mark request as paid, create COMPLETED transaction |
| **charge.failed**      | Payment failed     | Create FAILED transaction record                   |
| **transfer.completed** | Transfer completed | Update transaction, update wallet balance          |
| **refund.completed**   | Refund processed   | Mark transaction as REFUNDED                       |

## 🔄 Webhook Flow

```
Flutterwave sends webhook → POST /payment/flutterwave/webhook
    ↓
Extract event type and data
    ↓
Route to appropriate handler (charge.completed, charge.failed, etc.)
    ↓
Find request by tx_ref
    ↓
Update request status (if payment)
    ↓
Create/update transaction record
    ↓
Store Flutterwave metadata
    ↓
Return success response
```

## 📊 Transaction Handling

### Successful Payment (charge.completed)

```typescript
1. Find request by tx_ref
2. Update request.isRequestPaid = true
3. Create transaction:
   - status: COMPLETED
   - isInEscrow: true
   - escrowStatus: PENDING
   - amount: from webhook
   - metadata: Flutterwave data
```

### Failed Payment (charge.failed)

```typescript
1. Find request by tx_ref
2. Create transaction:
   - status: FAILED
   - metadata: failure reason
```

### Transfer Completed

```typescript
1. Find transaction by reference
2. Update transaction.status = COMPLETED
3. Update wallet balance (if not in escrow)
```

### Refund Completed

```typescript
1. Find transaction by tx_ref
2. Update transaction:
   - status: FAILED
   - escrowStatus: REFUNDED
   - metadata: refund data
```

## 🔑 Key Differences from Paystack

| Aspect                   | Paystack               | Flutterwave                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Reference Field**      | `data.reference`       | `data.tx_ref`                      |
| **Amount Format**        | Kobo (÷100 needed)     | Main currency unit (no conversion) |
| **Success Event**        | `charge.success`       | `charge.completed`                 |
| **Signature Header**     | `x-paystack-signature` | `verif-hash`                       |
| **Signature Validation** | Implemented            | Not implemented (as requested)     |

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- **No signature validation** (as requested)
- Public endpoint (no authentication)
- Always returns 200 OK
- Errors logged but not thrown

### Production Recommendations

1. Add signature validation using `verif-hash` header
2. Implement IP whitelist
3. Add rate limiting
4. Store webhook events for audit
5. Add idempotency checks

## 📝 Webhook URL Configuration

### Local Development

```
http://localhost:7000/payment/flutterwave/webhook
```

### Production

```
https://api.vybraa.com/payment/flutterwave/webhook
```

### Flutterwave Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to Settings → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL
3. Select events:
   - charge.completed
   - charge.failed
   - transfer.completed
   - refund.completed
4. Save configuration

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7000/payment/flutterwave/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "charge.completed",
    "data": {
      "tx_ref": "your-test-reference",
      "amount": 5000,
      "currency": "NGN",
      "status": "successful",
      "customer": {
        "email": "test@example.com"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "reference": "your-test-reference",
    "requestId": "req-uuid",
    "transactionId": "txn-uuid"
  }
}
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Log Messages

```
[PaymentController] Received Flutterwave webhook { event: 'charge.completed', ... }
[PaymentService] Processing Flutterwave payment success: VYBRAA_...
[PaymentService] Flutterwave payment processed successfully for request: req-uuid
[PaymentController] Flutterwave webhook processed { status: 'success', ... }
```

### Error Logs

```
[PaymentService] Error processing Flutterwave payment success: Error message
[PaymentController] Flutterwave webhook processing error { ... }
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test webhook** with Flutterwave sandbox
2. **Configure webhook URL** in Flutterwave dashboard
3. **Monitor logs** for webhook events
4. **Verify transactions** are created correctly
5. **Test all event types** (success, failed, transfer, refund)
